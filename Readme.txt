This Project was built with Nextjs framework and a variety of other libraries used for faster development execution.

The goal of this project is to create a platform where buyers and sellers of products can be matched based on image analysis.

A seller uploads the image of a product they are interested in selling. A buyer would upload the image of a product they are interested in buying.
Machine learning models would be in charge of matching the product and presenting it to the buyer.

Training machine learning models are out of the scope of this project, hence pre-trained models were used.

A variety of pre-trained models are available for image classification. Some of the popular models include Google's Cloud Vision Api and Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services which both require payment after a certain period of time.

A free alternative pre-trained model that was found is the TensorFlow's Coco SSD image classification model. A drawback of this model is that it does not offer a full coverage of all the features of the product. In other words, the images can only be classified by certain basic categories. An overview of the categories are provided in the link below.

Altough the image matching is very basic, this project serves as a prototype to a much more sophisticated idea of matching customer demands by visual information. The models and techniques can be upgraded upon in the future for a much better experience.
